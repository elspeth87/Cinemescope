<div class="about-text">

  <p> Currently available on Netflix, this charming indie Sci Fi Romance comes from the pen of Joss Whedon (Firefly, Buffy, Avengers). Directed by Brian Hill and starring two relative unknowns, Zoe Kazan and Michael Stahl-David, you can expect the nuanced, heartfelt, witty and engrossing story that Whedon is so well known for.</p>

  <p> Two strangers from separate corners of the states are connected by a telepathic link that allows them to see life through the otherâ€™s eyes and experience their strongest emotions. The result is a mind-bending insight into the disparity between the way we view ourselves and how we are perceived.</p>
