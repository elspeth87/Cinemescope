<div class="about-text">

  <p> Abortion clinic worker and half-hearted Catholic Bethany (Linda Florentino) is visited by an angel (Alan Rickman) and instructed to stop a couple of fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from ending the world. </p>

  <p> Written and directed by Kevin Smith (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), it somehow manages to satirises institutional Catholicism without criticising those with genuine faith. </p>

  <p> Co-starring Chris Rock, Jason Lee, Salma Hayek and George Carlin, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120655" targt="_blank" rel="nofollow">the film</a> is a mixture of toilet humour, road movie and religious dogma that somehow works. For fan’s of Smith’s work, don’t worry; Jay and Silent Bob lend helping hands. </p>
